<h1 class="noPrint">New Client Questionnaire</h1>
<h2 class="noPrint">Rationale</h2>
<p class="noPrint">When creating a new website, either from scratch or a redesign, you need to determine what your client is looking for. By asking a series of questions, you can determine the goals for the site and how it should look. Ideally, you would have your prospective client answer the <a href="#design">Design questions</a> ahead of time, and then you would talk through the remaining questions.</p>
