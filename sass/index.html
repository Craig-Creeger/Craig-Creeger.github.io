<header>SASS and Compass</header>
<div id="main">
	<p>The goal of SASS is to make reading and writing CSS easier. It also gives new functionality that CSS doesn’t have like performing math or using variables. This comes at the expense of having to learn Sassy CSS (SCSS) syntax and setting up some way to automatically compile the source files. Furthermore, debugging CSS won’t be quite as straight forward (although it does provide maps).</p>
	<p>I don’t find CSS particularly difficult to read or write, so the only thing I would really miss is variables.</p>
	<p style="background-color:yellow; font-weight:bold;">My recommendation: Ignore this technology unless the “pros” outweigh the “cons” for your situation.</p>

	<h1>Official Sites</h1>
	<h2>SASS — <a href="http://sass-lang.com" rel="external">http://sass-lang.com</a></h2>
	<p>SASS gives standard CSS some intelligence. For example <strong>variables</strong>, which are awesome for defining standard colors and schemes, functions (they call it <strong>mixins</strong>),  compiled <strong>includes</strong> (vs a separate HTTP request),  a nicer way to express dependent selectors (called <strong>nesting</strong>), inheritance (via the <strong>@extent</strong>), and computing values using mathematical expressions.</p>
	<h2>Compass — <a href="http://compass-style.org" rel="external">http://compass-style.org</a></h2>
	<p>Compass gives you a bunch of pre-build mixins and other functions. For example,</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Text truncation with ellipses</li>
		<li>Grid layout</li>
		<li>Footer stick</li>
		<li>Stretching an AP div to fill its container</li>
		<li>Automatically calculate image width and height</li>
		<li>Various color and math functions</li>
		<li>Setting default border-radius and shadows</li>
		<li>Adding vendor prefixs to box-sizing</li>
	</ul>
<h1>Installation</h1>
	<p>Installation is super easy on a Mac. Just install the Compass Gem (<kbd>gem install compass</kbd>) and optionally the CSS Parser (<kbd>gem install css_parser</kbd>) so that you can get some statistics on your CSS file by issuing <kbd>compass stats</kbd>.</p>
	<p>Now, create a new project using <a href="http://compass-style.org/install/" rel="external">http://compass-style.org/install/</a>, but this isn’t strictly necessary.	</p>
	<p>You can start a project with a &quot;reset&quot; stylesheet, but the one that comes with SASS kinda sucks (it screws with expected margins on paragraphs and bullets on lists). It would be better to @include the <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" rel="external">normalize.css</a> instead.</p>
	<h1>Use with Dreamweaver</h1>
	<div class="callout">
		<p>TLDR; It basically sucks with CS5.</p>
	</div>
	<ul>
		<li>Color coding of the .scss files is not build in.</li>
		<li>Constantly get the message “This file has been modified outside of Dreamweaver. Do you want to reload it?” when your page is still open in the editor, which is usually.</li>
		<li>You lose code hinting</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sure, there are some work arounds to make it less crappy – do some googling.</p>
	<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>If you would rather not compile your scss file each time it changes, you can have Compass watch your directory and automatically compile it each time it changes. The “watching” process will just keep running in your terminal window until you hit <kbd>Cntl+c</kbd>.</p>
<h1>Partials</h1>
<p>The partial files must start with an underscore, such as <code>_colors.scss</code></p>
<p>When importing the partial, you do not need to type the underscore or the extension. i.e.</p>
<p><code>@import 'colors'</code></p>
</div>
<footer> This is the footer </footer>
